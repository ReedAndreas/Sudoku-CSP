    "Below is the Blank class outlining Blank objects. First, the blank establishes basic info passed through parameters such as its index on the board and all of the rows, columns, and groups of the board which are each lists containing lists of numbers 1-9 or 0's representing a blank. The Blank uses its index to determine which row, column, and group is *its own*. For rows we can simply do integer division by 9 on the index describing its space in the 9x9 grid. Columns is simply a modulo of the index with 9. Its specific group is slightly more complicated so there is a helper method to determine that.\n",

This method iterates through numbers 1-9 and checks to see if they are present in either its row, column, or group already. The **continue** keyword just means go back up to the top of the loop and start the next iteration. So this method will only reach the append statement if the number is in none of these already. This means its a valid posibility and thus should be added to the **possibles list**. In the end, this list will comprise each number that is a valid move for the Blank which makes the program much more efficient than trying a new board filled with each number 1-9 and checking if it is a valid move."

    "The next cell is the Board class which is given a single paramter of *board* which is a list of 81 elements (9x9 grid). Based off of the board, methods are run to return lists of every row, column, and group in the board. These lists contain lists within them of numbers 1-9 or a 0 representing a blank. For example, *self.row[0][0]* would return the first number of the first row of the board. Then, the important **get_blanks** method is run where the program iterates through each number of the board and determines if it is filled and is constant or if it is a zero representing a blank. If it is zero, a Blank object is instantiated and added to the **blanks** list which contains each blank for the Board.\n",

In this method, the list of all blanks is sorted so that the blanks with the least number of possibilities in their *possibles list* are first. The first element of this list is selected to be the **chosen blank**. Then, random is used to randomly pop an item from the list and make a new board with that number (as opposed to a 0) filled in. Then, a Board object given this board as a parameter is returned. This returned object represents a state one move ahead of the parent. The logic is similar to that of how a human solves a sudoku. If a certain space only has 1 or 2 valid options instead of something like 5 or 6, it is much easier and more efficient to start with that because there will be less branching and fewer interations.

    "The following two methods are used in our generation of random solvable puzzles. Originally, I thought this process would be arduos considering you have to ensure that every time you are putting a number to create a puzzle it is still valid and not interfering with the members of its row, column, and group. Thinking through it however, I realized that we had already made this procecss happen in our solve method. **All the program needs to generate a random puzzle (completely filled in) is to call the solve method but instead of passing a puzzle to solve we pass a list of 81 0's signifying a blank board**. Due to the element of random choice in our logic for selecting possibilities, this will continually fill in blanks with random choices but they will always be valid because it is selecting from only a list of valid choices. So, a seemingly long proecss takes only 2 lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we generate a random puzzle with every number filled in, the **encrypt method** is run to take out a certain amount of numbers and replace them with blanks since the puzzle is not very fun if it is already solved. This method leaves a random number between 41 and 71 blanks to be filled. The min of 41 and max of 71 can be altered if desired. It is in place beause the vast majority of sudoku puzzles are in this range and otherwise you may be solving some pretty useless sudokus like some that have only one value filled in or every valued filled but 2 for example."

We see a relatively **direct** coorelation between elapsed_time and metrics like number_of_blanks meaning more blanks more time to solve whereas there appears to be an **inverse** coorelation between things like Max_in_Row and elapsed_time meaning the more in a row the easier a puzzle is to solve. Both of these findings are logical if we think about the way in which Sudoku is solved."

    "Our next interesting task is something a website like sudoku.com may be faced with. Generating large amounts of random puzzles for users to solve. However, how should we determine the difficulty of these? We ccould solve them with the computer and track the amount of time that takes. However, especially as the number of puzzles needed grows immensely, solving each one would be ardous. Instead, we can use the information we have between the relationship of easily calcuclated metrics and the time it takes to solve a puzzle. We can create a linear regression model to look at a puzzle and determine how long it **thinks** it will take to solve as opposed to actually having to solve it. Will this be that much more efficient, however? Let's find out..."
